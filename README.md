This is a self-hosted WhatsApp CRM application.

## Features

- **Shared inbox** on the official WhatsApp Business API — multiple
  agents working one number, per-conversation assignment, status, and
  notes.
- **Contacts + tags + custom fields**, CSV import, deduplication.
- **Sales pipelines** (Kanban) with deals linked to conversations.
- **Broadcasts** with Meta-approved templates, delivery + read
  tracking, per-recipient variable substitution.
- **No-code automations** — triggers on inbound messages, new
  contacts, keywords, or schedule; conditional branches, waits,
  tags, webhooks. Visual builder.
- **Real-time dashboard** — response times, daily volume, pipeline
  value, cross-module activity feed.
- **Team accounts** — invite teammates by link, role-based access
  (owner / admin / agent / viewer), ownership transfer. Every install
  is account-scoped, so one shared inbox can be staffed by a whole
  team. Solo use stays single-user with zero setup.
- **Account management** — email, password, avatar, global sign-out.
